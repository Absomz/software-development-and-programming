## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is my **personal journey through software development and programming**, structured as a growing archive of study notes, technical analysis, and real-world reflections. It starts with the **most essential programming foundations** and progresses toward advanced topics aligned with professional engineering standards.

It is designed to serve **two core purposes**:

- 📚 **Study Notebook:** Organized educational material across topics, from beginner to expert.
- 💼 **Portfolio:** Evidence of learning, skills, and professional growth over time.

## 🚀 Vision & Trajectory

This is not just a collection of notes. It's a **chronicle of transformation**, aligned with my personal and professional milestones:

1. **🔹 Initial Stage:** Foundations of programming, logic, testing, and debugging.
2. **🔸 Intermediate Stage:** Object-oriented design, software architecture, databases, project management.
3. **🟠 Advanced Stage:** Specialization in AI, data science, and complex system design.
4. **🔵 MIT Entry & Completion:** Documenting my admission, studies, and experiences at MIT.
5. **🟢 Post-MIT:** Real-world engineering cases, work-related challenges, complex debugging logs, and architecture decisions.

Every section reflects my growth and evolving mindset as a software engineer.
